### A gRPC server written in Kotlin to handle real time (terminal based) chat with multiple gRPC clients. 
* You can connect to any gRPC client written for the same proto file. I have tested it with golang gRPC client so it worked fine.

##### More upcoming updates
- As my kotlin learning journey I am goind to add some more features like more rooms, sound notification on a new joining, current online users etc.
- later i might add authentication as well.
- Every thing will be in gRPC not in HTTP for the entier project.
